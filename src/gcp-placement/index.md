title: GCP Placement
...

Ground control points, or GCPs, are crucial in
photogrammetry to obtain accurate outputs. These are
typically clearly visible physical markers on the ground,
for which _highly accurate positional information_ is
available. The accurate positions are used in photogrammetry
to improve the accuracy of the outputs.

GCPs form an integral part of the Vimana platform. We
provide workflow for the placement, and usage of GCPs.

In this blog, we describe our procedure for the placement of
GCPs.

\newcommand{\curly}[1]{\left\{ {#1} \right\}}
\newcommand{\X}{\mathcal{X}}

# GCP Placement

Our research indicates that $\X = \curly{ x \mid x \in \X
}.$
